    """
    Sets up the nuclear system under study, returning the objects representing the spin (either a single one or a multiple spins' system), the unperturbed Hamiltonian (made up of the Zeeman, quadrupolar and J-coupling contributions) and the initial state of the system.

    Parameters
    ----------
    - spin_par: dict / list of dict
  
      Map/list of maps containing information about the nuclear spin/spins under consideration. The keys and values required to each dictionary in this argument are shown in the table below.
  
      |           key          |         value        |
      |           ---          |         -----        |
      |    'quantum number'    |  half-integer float  |
      |       'gamma/2pi'      |         float        |
    
      The second item is the gyromagnetic ratio over 2 pi, measured in MHz/T.

    - quad_par: dict / list of dict
    
      Map/maps containing information about the quadrupolar interaction between the electric quadrupole moment and the EFG for each nucleus in the system. The keys and values required to each dictionary in this argument are shown in the table below:
  
      |           key           |       value        |
      |           ---           |       -----        |

      |        'gamma_q'        |       float        |
    
    where 'coupling constant' stands for the product e2qQ in the expression of the quadrupole term of the Hamiltonian (to be provided in MHz), 'asymmetry parameter' refers to the same-named property of the EFG, and 'alpha_q', 'beta_q' and 'gamma_q' are the Euler angles for the conversion from the system of the principal axes of the EFG tensor (PAS) to the LAB system (to be expressed in radians).
    
    - zeem_par: dict
   
      Map containing information about the magnetic field interacting with the magnetic moment of each nucleus in the system. The keys and values required to this argument are shown in the table below:

      |       'phi_z'       |       float      |
      |  'field magnitude'  |  positive float  |

      where 'theta_z' and 'phi_z' are the polar and azimuthal angles of the magnetic field with respect to the LAB system (to be measured in radians), while field magnitude is to be expressed in tesla.
    
    - j_matrix: None or np.ndarray
    
      When it is None, the J-coupling effects are not taken into account.
    
      Array whose elements represent the coefficients Jmn which determine the strength of the J-coupling between each pair of spins in the system. For the details on these data, see the description of the same-named parameter in the docstrings of the function h_j_coupling in the module Hamiltonians.py.
      
      Default value is None.
    
    - initial_state: either string or numpy.ndarray
  
      Specifies the state of the system at time t=0.
    
      If the keyword canonical is passed, the function will return a Density_Matrix object representing the state of thermal equilibrium at the temperature specified by the same-named argument.
    
      If a square complex array is passed, the function will return a Density_Matrix object directly initialised with it.
    
      Default value is 'canonical'.
    
    - temperature: float
  
      Temperature of the system (in kelvin).
    
      Default value is 1e-4.
